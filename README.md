# GhGl
Old c++ project with few graphic effects implemented with OpenGL and puzzle solving visualization tool.

## Lines

Prototype of blurred lines live wallpaper later implemented in java on android as [blurred-lines-live](https://github.com/ghisguth/blurred-lines-live) project.
And then moved to [sunlight](https://github.com/ghisguth/sunlight) project.

## Spiral

Barely remember how I implemented this project. I think I borrowed idea or even code from some other project and then used that idea to build other projects like grid or lines.

## Puzle solver

I got hend on one puzzle which supposed to form 3d object. But it was hard to solve. So I implemented program to visualize it and brute force solution.
